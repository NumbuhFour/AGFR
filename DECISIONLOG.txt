Editor GUI components will be on one atlas.
	-Thought it might be easier to just split it. Theres no real reason to split it anyway. 
	I kinda forgot why i didnt for the game area

GameTime versus built in Time
	-Alterations based on Time.deltaTime or Time.time can't account for pause

Most level editor UI things dont inherit from game UI
	-Game ui has attributes unneeded for the LE (mostly the item class equivalents)
	-LE needs more attributes
	-It would get pretty messy

Tile's "constructor" is publicly accessible Init
	-So tile can be remade without losing references (level editor)
